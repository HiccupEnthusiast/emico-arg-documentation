          <h2>How to navigate troughout this documentation</h2>
          <p>At the top you will always find the navigation bar which will the main way you are going to move through this documentation. A brief explanation is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b><a href="./index.html">Home:</a></b> This page, main hub for ARG(s)</li>
            <li><b><a href="./cyphers.html">Cyphers:</a></b> In this section you will find information about the cypher used through the series. You'll find how to encrypt and unencrypt data using it, how does it work, and where has it been used.</li>
            <li><b><a href="./videos.html">Videos:</a></b> Probably the section you'll be most of the time, it contains all the information we have in the multimedia <i>(So far only videos, a page, and a mini-game, prone to change)</i> found across all the ARG(s). It's named just "videos" since that's the main multimedia we've worked with and most people will be searching for it. <b><i><u>Good starting point!</u></i></b></li>
            <li><b><a href="./chronological.html">Chronological timeline:</a></b> In an effort to organize the multimedia so we can focus in theorizing, in this section you'll find the most updated timelines with its possible caveats. Remember, we don't have any official timeline, <b><i><u>everything in here is speculative</u></i></b> feel free to discuss anything in here <a href="#Contact">with us!.</a></li>
            <li><b><a href="./unsolved.html">Unsolved secrets:</a></b> In this section you can find any secret that hasn't been found a solution. We highly encourage you to enter here and give it a try!.</li>
            <li><b><u><i>Theories section will be taken care of later on.</i></u></b></li>
          </ul>

        <div class="other-args">
          <h2 id="otherargs">Other ARGs?</h2>
          <p>Yes! We'll be documenting ARGs that are either directly related to Emico's work, or were made and participated by or in <a href="inv">Emicord's community!.</a> If you are interested in making an ARG don't doubt in <a href="#contact">contacting us</a> so we all can give it a look and solve it. We're always keen for new challenges ;)</p>
