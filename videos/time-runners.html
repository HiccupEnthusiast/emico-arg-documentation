          <div class="block">
            <p>This video could be divided in two main parts, the first one we see our protagonist (In this case <a href="....">Amelia watson</a>) wander through some lonely alleys, eventually she'll find what at first glance appears to be holographic version of <a href="....">Gawr Gura</a> and they interchange a few words. After the brief conversation, Amelia looks at her watch and apparently goes to the past, more specifically to the same place and possibly time in which the events of <a href="./drifting-time.html">"Watson's Drifting Time Misplaced"</a> occur. In here we meet our third character, <a href="....">Ninomae Ina'nis</a>, who talks with our detective. The video ends with the blonde girl muttering some words.</p>

          <p>In the first minute of the video we don't see a lot of relevant things. We hear some voices that doesn't have any meaning confirmed yet. Some details that may be worth keeping are the <i>"Prologue"</i> text that appears when the title does, which may indicate this is just the beginning or something bigger. The other thing that may be worth keeping in mind is <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Arasaka" target="_blank">the tree-like symbol</a> that apears. It's the same as the one that "Arasaka", a fictional corporation in the Cyberpunk universe uses. This may be hinting that these videos is set in the future way ahead the main story develops. We see some KFP flyers around, which, if the former hypothesis is true, this would mean this <a href="....">timeline</a> would most likely had Kiara survive and recover everything, continuing with her successful KFP manager career.</p>

          <p>When Amelia appears, the first detail we must take in is the fact that <b><u><i>she isn't wearing her coat</i></u></b>. This may indicate that we are following <a href="...." target="_blank">"Ame 2".</a> <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E8%A1%8C%E6%96%B9%E4%B8%8D" target="_blank">"'行方不' (明)"</a> can be found in the background, besides a KFP sign, it can be translated as "missing". This whole scene seems to be heavily influenced by a scene from the movie "Bladerunner 2049", where Agent K (The protagonist) talks with a hologram about loneliness. Here's a transcript of both conversations:

            <p>After this conversation, Gura seemingly disappears, hinting that the person who Amelia 2 talked to may have been a hologram or illusion created by Amelia 2's self-doubts. Where before Gura was, we can see a luminiscent sign that says "Gura's Ramen Shop", this may mean that this is some sort of mental construction, or that Gura created a successful Ramen food-chain/one was created in honor to her.</p>

            <p>After some moments of reflexion, Amelia 2 uses her watch and a sequence representing her going back in time is played. The clock starts and ends pointing 0300. During this sequence we can see <a href="#cyphers">six cyphers</a>. When it is over we can see Amelia 2 looking at her watch, which is roughly pointing to 0112. She eventually turns her head, and we can see Ina'nis standing in front of a store. The Japanese that we can see "らの鶏を食べる // (食)べ放題 // 気を付けて" which translates to "Eat chicken // Buffet // Be careful" respectively.</p>

              <p>Near the end, we receive a lot of important information. Firstly we have a close-up to Amelia's clothes, here we can see that she's wearing a coat and a red tie. The same attire that the Amelia who supposedly got shot was wearing. Then we cut to a shot of Ina'nis and she starts to talk with Amelia: <br> <br>
                I: Do you really think you are clever, Amelia? <br>
                I: You shouldn't have disobeyed the reality you were destined <br>
                I: You should've just accepted it for what it is <br>
                <i>The words "USELESS" and "MEANT FOR DEATH" appear around Ina'nis</i> <br>
                I: A meaningless death for a detective like you  <br>
                I: Why can't you just give up, Amelia? <br>
                <i>The shot goes back to Amelia and the words "DELUSION" and "CLEVER" surround her</i> <br>
                I: I guess giving up isn't really an option as a detective <br>
                I: It doesn't matter anyways, you're just gonna die over and over again <br>
                I: Can't you see Amelia? We are going to be inside a loop if you keep this up <br>
                <i>Screen goes black and yellow text, attributed to Amelia appears: </i>
                A: Who said I was the one who would keep this all up? <br>
                A: Gura, I hope you know what you're doing <br>
